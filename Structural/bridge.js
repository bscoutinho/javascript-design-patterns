/* 
Bridge
It separates the abstraction from the implementation so that the two can vary independently.

According to Wikipedia:
Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes into two separate hierarchies 
— abstraction and implementation — which can be developed independently of each other.

Example
We will be creating Renderer classes for rendering multiple shapes,

    renderCircle(radius) {
        console.log(`Drawing a circle of radius ${radius}`)

class RasterRenderer {
    renderCircle(radius) {

class Shape {
